# Changelog

All notable changes to Nogat are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions of
the standard are listed in [standards/README.md](standards/README.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`: the registry tooling runs in the locked
  project environment; ruff, mypy, pytest, shellcheck and actionlint come
  from the lock (DEV-5.3, DEV-6.3).
- Tests of `scripts/ecosystem.py` in `tests/`, run by the gate with an 80%
  coverage floor (DEV-7.5, DEV-7.6).

### Changed

- `scripts/gate.sh` follows `standards/ci/gate.sh`: `uv sync --locked`, the
  DEV-7.2 rule set, mypy over `scripts/` and `tests/`, pytest with coverage.

### Fixed

- `deps` no longer reports conflicts between overlapping ranges such as
  `<3` and `>2.5`.
- `drift` keeps VCS refs containing `/` (`@release/0.8`), labels a project
  without manifests "no manifest", and takes the newest final release tag as
  latest instead of a release candidate sorted after it.
- Requirements files are read as pip reads them: line continuations,
  `--hash` options and `-r` includes.
- A missing or malformed `ecosystem.yaml`, JSON or manifest gives a one-line
  error naming the file instead of a traceback; `deps --installed` notes an
  environment it cannot list.
- `validate` reports a topic document of the standard without its
  "Part of standard X.Y" line.
